Target: teenagers

## v1 — Unfair MVP
**Timeline:** 0-3 months

### Problem Statement
Social platforms optimize for engagement, not meaningful connection. Users feel drained, not connected.

### Target User
People seeking genuine community around specific interests, not broad social networking.

### Use Case
SocialSphere helps teenagers thoughtfully designed for social workflows.

### Must-Have Features
- User Profiles
- News Feed
- Messaging
- Groups
- Events

### Intentionally Not Built
- Algorithmic feed
- Advertising
- Follower counts
- Content monetization
- Cross-platform sharing

### Success Metrics
- Message depth (replies per thread) > 5
- Return visits driven by content, not notifications
- Member retention > 60% at 90 days
- Self-reported quality of connections

### Technical Constraints
- No engagement-maximizing algorithms
- Privacy by default
- Moderation tools for community safety

---

## v2 — Scale & Moat
**Timeline:** 3-12 months

### Feature Expansions
- Sub-groups within communities
- Collaborative documents/wikis
- Member directory with search
- Integration with calendar apps
- Mobile apps with gentle notifications

### Architecture Evolution
- Add real-time messaging infrastructure
- Introduce collaborative editing
- Build calendar sync system

### Scaling Considerations
- Communities up to 10K members
- Message history preservation
- Media storage for community content

### Moat Building
- Community relationships create strong retention
- Content history is collective memory
- Moderation norms become community culture

### Monetization
$25/month for advanced features. Community tiers based on member count.

---

## v3 — Category King
**Timeline:** 12-36 months

### Category Expansion
From community platform to "relationship infrastructure" for interest-based networks.

### Platform Strategy
Inter-community connections, event hosting services, community analytics for organizers.

### Strategic Partnerships
- Event platforms for seamless hosting
- Professional communities for networking
- Educational institutions for learning communities

### Differentiation Narrative
The only social platform designed for depth over breadth—quality connections, not follower counts.

### Advanced Monetization
Event ticketing fees (5%). Enterprise community management ($5/member/month).

## Feature Progression Map

| Feature | v1 | v2 | v3 |

| Discussion | Threaded conversations | Rich media, collaborative docs | AI-summarized threads, knowledge base |
| Events | Basic RSVP and details | Calendar integration, reminders | Hybrid virtual/in-person, recording archive |
| Discovery | Browse public communities | Interest matching, recommendations | Cross-community connections, skill matching |
| User Management | Basic CRUD, list view | Advanced filtering, bulk operations | Intelligent suggestions, automation |

## Architecture Evolution Notes

- Add WebSocket infrastructure for real-time
- Introduce collaborative editing (CRDT)
- Build moderation queue system

### v2 → v3 Transition
- Add recommendation engine

### Technical Debt Acknowledgements

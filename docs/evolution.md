# Product Evolution Roadmap

## Overview

Every product generated by Oaxe includes a time-aware evolution roadmap from v1 (Unfair MVP) through v3 (Category King). This document defines the framework for planning and executing product evolution.

## Evolution Philosophy

1. **Ship v1 fast** — Speed to market beats feature completeness
2. **Earn the right to v2** — User traction justifies expansion
3. **Build moats in v2** — Data, network effects, integrations
4. **Platformize in v3** — Ecosystem creates defensibility
5. **Never break trust** — Evolution adds value, never removes it

## Version Framework

### v1 — Unfair MVP

**Timeline:** 2-4 weeks from start

**Objective:** Dominate a specific niche with a focused, polished solution.

**Characteristics:**
- Minimum viable feature set (5-10 features)
- Maximum polish on core flow
- Single, clear value proposition
- One "signature" interaction
- One "brand moment" screen
- Obvious technical shortcuts (documented)
- Clear activation and retention loop

**Success Criteria:**
- Users say "finally, someone built this"
- Core flow completion rate > 80%
- D7 retention > 15%
- Organic word-of-mouth visible

**Allowed Shortcuts:**
- Single database region
- Basic error handling
- Minimal admin tooling
- Manual customer support
- No analytics deep-dives

### v2 — Scale & Moat

**Timeline:** 3-6 months post-launch

**Objective:** Expand feature set, build defensibility, introduce monetization.

**Characteristics:**
- Feature expansion (20-40 features)
- UX depth (power user features)
- Data moat creation (user-generated, learning)
- Infrastructure scaling
- Monetization introduction
- Team growth support

**Success Criteria:**
- Revenue or clear path to revenue
- D30 retention > 25%
- Power users emerging
- Competitors attempting to copy

**Moat Types to Build:**
- Data advantage (user data improves product)
- Network effects (more users = more value)
- Integration depth (workflow lock-in)
- Brand affinity (users identify with product)
- Switching costs (data, learning curve)

### v3 — Category King

**Timeline:** 12-24 months post-launch

**Objective:** Own the category, platform for ecosystem, enterprise-ready.

**Characteristics:**
- Platform capabilities (APIs, webhooks, SDKs)
- Ecosystem (integrations, partners, marketplace)
- Enterprise features (SSO, audit logs, compliance)
- Advanced personalization / ML
- Internationalization
- Category-defining positioning

**Success Criteria:**
- Category associated with product name
- Enterprise customers paying premium
- Third-party integrations built without prompting
- Acquisition interest or IPO trajectory

## Evolution Decisions

### When to Advance Versions

**v1 → v2:**
- Revenue > $10K MRR or 10K active users
- Core metrics healthy (retention, activation)
- Clear demand for expansion features
- Team capacity to support growth

**v2 → v3:**
- Revenue > $100K MRR or 100K active users
- Enterprise inbound requests
- Integration requests from partners
- Category leadership visible

### What to Deprecate

**Safe to Remove:**
- Features with < 5% usage
- Redundant capabilities
- Technical debt features
- Experiment failures

**Never Remove:**
- Core workflow features
- Paid tier features (without migration path)
- Data access (always exportable)
- Integrations with active users

### How to Migrate

1. **Announce** — 90 days notice minimum
2. **Provide alternative** — Never leave users stranded
3. **Export data** — Always allow extraction
4. **Sunset gradually** — Read-only → warning → removal

## Evolution Anti-Patterns

### Premature v2

- Adding features before v1 is proven
- Scaling before finding product-market fit
- Monetizing before delivering value
- Building moats without users

### Feature Creep

- Every request becomes a feature
- No saying no
- No deprecation
- Complexity compounds

### Pivot Without Data

- Changing direction based on feeling
- Ignoring user behavior
- Chasing competitors
- Abandoning working features

### Enterprise Before Ready

- SOC 2 before revenue
- Custom features for one customer
- Complex pricing before simple works
- Enterprise sales without product-market fit

Target: Sales Managers

---

## v1 — Unfair MVP
**Timeline:** 0-3 months

### Problem Statement
Developer tools assume you already know what you need. Setup friction, configuration complexity, and undocumented edge cases slow teams down.

### Target User
Small engineering teams (3-15 engineers) at startups who need to ship fast without dedicated DevOps.

### Use Case
SalesMind helps sales managers thoughtfully designed for technology workflows.

### Must-Have Features
- AI-driven task automation
- Predictive sales analytics
- Automated lead management
- Customizable sales pipelines
- Integrated communication channels

### Intentionally Not Built
- Cloud hosting or deployment
- Team collaboration features
- Monitoring and alerting
- CI/CD pipelines
- Multi-region support

### Success Metrics
- Setup to first request < 5 minutes
- Zero "works on my machine" issues
- Documentation search success > 90%
- GitHub stars as proxy for adoption

### Technical Constraints
- Works on Mac, Linux, and WSL2
- No proprietary cloud dependencies
- Runs in CI environments without modification

---

## v2 — Scale & Moat
**Timeline:** 3-12 months

### Feature Expansions
- Team configuration sharing
- Basic deployment to major clouds
- Environment variable management
- Integration test helpers
- Plugin system for extensions

### Architecture Evolution
- Add plugin architecture with stable API
- Introduce remote state management
- Build cloud adapter abstraction

### Scaling Considerations
- Support monorepos with 100+ packages
- Parallel execution for CI speed
- Incremental builds based on change detection

### Moat Building
- Plugin ecosystem creates community investment
- Team configurations become institutional knowledge
- Open source contributions build trust and lock-in

### Monetization
Open source core. Pro plugins at $19/month for teams.

---

## v3 — Category King
**Timeline:** 12-36 months

### Category Expansion
From developer tool to "developer platform" that handles the full local-to-production lifecycle.

### Platform Strategy
Managed cloud offering for teams who want zero-ops, plugin marketplace with revenue sharing, enterprise support contracts.

### Strategic Partnerships
- Cloud providers for native integrations
- CI/CD platforms for deep integration
- Enterprise vendors for compliance certifications

### Differentiation Narrative
The only developer tool that prioritizes "time to productive" over feature count—complexity is opt-in, not default.

### Advanced Monetization
Managed cloud at $99/month/team. Enterprise at $499/month with SSO and support.

## Feature Progression Map

| Feature | v1 | v2 | v3 |
|---------|----|----|-----|
| Setup | CLI with interactive prompts | Team templates with customization | AI-assisted from README or existing code |
| Configuration | Single config file with comments | Environment-specific overrides | Drift detection and auto-remediation |
| Deployment | Export for manual deploy | Push-button to major clouds | Managed hosting with preview environments |
| User Management | Basic CRUD, list view | Advanced filtering, bulk operations | Intelligent suggestions, automation |

---

## Architecture Evolution Notes

### v1 → v2 Transition
- Introduce plugin system with versioned API
- Add remote state backend option
- Build cloud provider abstraction layer

### v2 → v3 Transition
- Add control plane for managed offering
- Introduce usage-based billing infrastructure
- Build enterprise RBAC and audit logging

### Technical Debt Acknowledgements
- v1 cloud logic is hardcoded—needs provider abstraction
- Config parsing is custom—needs standard format support
- Error messages are static—needs context-aware suggestions

---

## Monetization Evolution

### v1 Pricing
Free and open source. No commercial offering.

### v2 Pricing
Open source core. Pro plugins at $19/month for teams.

### v3 Pricing
Managed cloud at $99/month/team. Enterprise at $499/month with SSO and support.
